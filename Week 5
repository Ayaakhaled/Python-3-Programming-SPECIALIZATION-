Q1)You will be sorting the following list by each element’s second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when sorting, called second_let. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string. Then sort the list, create a variable called sorted_by_second_let and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']
def second_let(text):
    return text[1]

sorted_by_second_let = sorted(ex_lst, key = second_let )


Q2) Below, we have provided a list of strings called nums. Write a function called last_char that takes a string as input, and returns only its last character. Use this function to sort the list nums by the last digit of each number, from highest to lowest, and save this as a new list called nums_sorted.
nums = ['1450', '33', '871', '19', '14378', '32', '1005', '44', '8907', '16']
def last_char(text):
    return text[-1]
nums_sorted = sorted(nums,reverse = True , key= last_char ) 


Q3) Once again, sort the list nums based on the last digit of each number from highest to lowest. However, now you should do so by writing a lambda function. Save the new list as nums_sorted_lambda.

Q1) Sort the following string alphabetically, from z to a, and assign it to the variable sorted_letters.

letters = "alwnfiwaksuezlaeiajsdl"
sorted_letters = sorted(letters, reverse = True )


Q2) Sort the list below, animals, into alphabetical order, a-z. Save the new list as animals_sorted.
animals = ['elephant', 'cat', 'moose', 'antelope', 'elk', 'rabbit', 'zebra', 'yak', 'salamander', 'deer', 'otter', 'minx', 'giraffe', 'goat', 'cow', 'tiger', 'bear']
animals_sorted = sorted(animals)



Q3) The dictionary, medals, shows the medal count for six countries during the Rio Olympics. Sort the country names so they appear alphabetically. Save this list to the variable alphabetical.
medals = {'Japan':41, 'Russia':56, 'South Korea':21, 'United States':121, 'Germany':42, 'China':70}
alphabetical = sorted(medals.keys())


Q4) Given the same dictionary, medals, now sort by the medal count. Save the three countries with the highest medal count to the list, top_three.

medals = {'Japan':41, 'Russia':56, 'South Korea':21, 'United States':121, 'Germany':42, 'China':70}
def return_value(key):
    return medals[key]

top_three = sorted(medals, key = return_value , reverse = True ) [0:3]

Q5) We have provided the dictionary groceries. You should return a list of its keys, but they should be sorted by their values, from highest to lowest. Save the new list as most_needed.
groceries = {'apples': 5, 'pasta': 3, 'carrots': 12, 'orange juice': 2, 'bananas': 8, 'popcorn': 1, 'salsa': 3, 'cereal': 4, 'coffee': 5, 'granola bars': 15, 'onions': 7, 'rice': 1, 'peanut butter': 2, 'spinach': 9}

def return_value(key):
    return groceries[key]

most_needed = sorted(groceries, key = return_value , reverse = True )
print(most_needed)



Q6) Create a function called last_four that takes in an ID number and returns the last four digits. For example, the number 17573005 should return 3005. Then, use this function to sort the list of ids stored in the variable, ids, from lowest to highest. Save this sorted list in the variable, sorted_ids. Hint: Remember that only strings can be indexed, so conversions may be needed.
def last_four(x):
    x = str(x)
    return x[-4:]
ids = [17573005, 17572342, 17579000, 17570002, 17572345, 17579329]
sorted_ids = sorted(ids, key = last_four , reverse = False )


Q7) Sort the list ids by the last four digits of each id. Do this using lambda and not using a defined function. Save this sorted list in the variable sorted_id.

ids = [17573005, 17572342, 17579000, 17570002, 17572345, 17579329]

sorted_id = sorted(ids, key = lambda i : str(i)[-4:])

Q8) Sort the following list by each element’s second letter a to z. Do so by using lambda. Assign the resulting value to the variable lambda_sort.
ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']

lambda_sort = sorted(ex_lst, key = lambda i : i[1])
