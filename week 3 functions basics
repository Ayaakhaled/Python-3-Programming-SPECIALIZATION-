    sum_alist = 0 
    for item in alist:
        sum_alist = sum_alist + item
    return sum_alist

Q10)  Write a function called count that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a count of the number of elements in the list.
code.

Q1) Write a function called int_return that takes an integer as input and returns the same integer.
code.
def int_return(int_num):
    return int_num
    
Q2) Write a function called add that takes any number as its input and returns that sum with 2 added.
code.
def add(num):
    return num + 2
    
Q3) Write a function called change that takes any string, adds “Nice to meet you!” to the end of the argument given, and returns that new string.
code.
def change(text):
    new_str = text + "Nice to meet you!"
    return new_str
    
Q4) Write a function, accum, that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of those integers.

    for num in ilist:
        total = total + num
    return total 
 
Q5) Write a function, length, that takes in a list as the input. If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 5, return “Longer than 5”. If the length is less than 5, return “Less than 5”.
code.
def length(alist):
    if len(alist) >= 5 :
        text = "Longer than 5"
    else : 
        text = "Less than 5"
    return text

Q6) You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.
code.
def divide(num):
    div_num = num / 2
    return div_num
def sum(num):
    div_num = divide(num)
    add_num = div_num + 6
    return add_num
